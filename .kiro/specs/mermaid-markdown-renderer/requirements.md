# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to enable proper rendering of Mermaid diagrams within Markdown files in the blog system. Currently, Mermaid code blocks in Markdown files are not being parsed and rendered as interactive diagrams, which limits the visual presentation of technical content like system architecture diagrams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a blog author, I want to include Mermaid diagrams in my Markdown blog posts, so that I can visually represent complex system architectures and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Markdown file contains a Mermaid code block with ```mermaid syntax THEN the system SHALL render it as an interactive diagram
2. WHEN the blog page loads THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL be automatically processed and displayed
3. WHEN a Mermaid diagram fails to render THEN the system SHALL display the original code block as fallback

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a blog reader, I want to view properly rendered diagrams in blog posts, so that I can better understand the technical concepts being explained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a blog post with Mermaid diagrams THEN the diagrams SHALL be visually clear and interactive
2. WHEN hovering over diagram elements THEN tooltips or highlights SHALL be displayed where applicable
3. WHEN the page is responsive THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL scale appropriately for different screen sizes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Mermaid rendering to work seamlessly with the existing Next.js blog system, so that no major architectural changes are required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating Mermaid support THEN it SHALL work with the existing Markdown processing pipeline
2. WHEN building the application THEN Mermaid dependencies SHALL be properly bundled
3. WHEN the system processes Markdown THEN Mermaid blocks SHALL be identified and processed correctly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to preview Mermaid diagrams during development, so that I can verify they render correctly before publishing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN editing Markdown files in development mode THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL render in real-time
2. WHEN there are syntax errors in Mermaid code THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed
3. WHEN hot-reloading occurs THEN Mermaid diagrams SHALL re-render without page refresh
